## What is Bronson?

Bronson is an opinionated module application framework for the building of large scale javascript applications. It sits on top of RequireJS and makes the loading, unloading, management and communication of your modular web components easier and more importantly loosely coupled. Bronson was born from the need to do modular application development in the real world not just on single page applications.

### Features
- Extensible base module object reflecting the typical life cycle of a standalone widget.
- Easy to use API for the loading, unloading, starting, stopping modules.
- Fast, managed, framework agnostic publish/subscribe system built for module to module as well as application wide communication.
- Permissions controller for management of communication
- Cross browser tested IE8 + Modern Browsers.
- Only dependency is RequireJS
